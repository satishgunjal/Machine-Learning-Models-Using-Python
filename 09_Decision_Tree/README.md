# Introduction
1. Decisions trees are the most powerful algorithms that falls under the category of supervised algorithms.
2. Unlike other supervised learning algorihms decision tree can be used to solve regression and classification problems
3. The goal of decision tree is to create training model that can predict class or value by learning simple decision rules from training data
4. The two main entities of a tree are decision nodes, where the data is split and leaves, where we got outcome.
5. Decision tree algorithm forms the tree, based on 'High Information Gain'. Lower the entropy higher the information gain.
6. Entropy: It is basically a measure of randomness in your sample. So if there is no randomness in your sample then then entropy is low.
7. Types of decision tree
   - Classification decision trees − In this kind of decision trees, the decision variable is categorical. The above decision tree is an example of classification decision tree.
   - Regression decision trees − In this kind of decision trees, the decision variable is continuous.
